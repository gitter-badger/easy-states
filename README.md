## What is Easy States?

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/j-easy/easy-states](https://badges.gitter.im/j-easy/easy-states.svg)](https://gitter.im/j-easy/easy-states?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Easy States is an event-driven [Deterministic Finite Automaton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_state_machine) implementation in Java.

It is inspired by [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-5.9.3/doc/design_principles/fsm.html) design principles which describe a Finite State Machine as a set of relations of the form:

`State(S) x Event(E) -> Actions(A), State(S')`

These relations are interpreted like follows:

If we are in state `S` and the event `E` occurs, we should perform action(s) `A` and make a transition to the state `S'`.

## How does it work?

Easy States provides APIs for key concepts of state machines:

* `State`: a particular state the machine can be on at given point in time
* `Event`: represents an event that may trigger an action and change the state of the machine
* `Transition`: represents a transition between two states of the machine when an event occurs
* `FinateStateMachine`: core abstraction of finite state machine

Using Easy States, you can define FSM transitions with an intuitive fluent API:

```java
Transition t = new TransitionBuilder()
        .sourceState(s0) //if we are in state s0
        .eventType(Event.class) // and the event E occurs
        .eventHandler(myActionA) // we should perform the actions A
        .targetState(s1) // and make a transition to the state s1
        .build();
```
## Two minutes tutorial

This tutorial is an implementation of the turnstile example described in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">wikipedia</a>:

A turnstile has two states: `Locked` and `Unlocked`. There are two inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot (coin) and pushing the arm (push).
In the locked state, pushing on the arm has no effect; no matter how many times the input push is given it stays in the locked state.
Putting a coin in, that is giving the machine a coin input, shifts the state from Locked to Unlocked.
In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional coin inputs does not change the state.

![turnsitle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-easy/easy-states/master/easy-states-tutorials/src/main/resources/turnstile.png)

For this example, we define:

* two events: `PushEvent` and `CoinEvent`
* two actions: `Lock` and `Unlock`
* four transitions: `pushLocked`, `unlock`, `coinUnlocked` and `lock`

The complete code of the example is the following:

```java
public class Launcher {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws FiniteStateMachineException {

        /*
         * Define FSM states
         */
        State locked = new State("locked");
        State unlocked = new State("unlocked");

        Set<State> states = new HashSet<State>();
        states.add(locked);
        states.add(unlocked);

        /*
         * Define FSM transitions
         */
        Transition unlock = new TransitionBuilder()
                .name("unlock")
                .sourceState(locked)
                .eventType(CoinEvent.class)
                .eventHandler(new Unlock())
                .targetState(unlocked)
                .build();

        Transition pushLocked = new TransitionBuilder()
                .name("pushLocked")
                .sourceState(locked)
                .eventType(PushEvent.class)
                .targetState(locked)
                .build();

        Transition lock = new TransitionBuilder()
                .name("lock")
                .sourceState(unlocked)
                .eventType(PushEvent.class)
                .eventHandler(new Lock())
                .targetState(locked)
                .build();

        Transition coinUnlocked = new TransitionBuilder()
                .name("coinUnlocked")
                .sourceState(unlocked)
                .eventType(CoinEvent.class)
                .targetState(unlocked)
                .build();

        /*
         * Build FSM instance
         */
        FiniteStateMachine finiteStateMachine = new FiniteStateMachineBuilder("Turnstile state machine", states, locked)
                .registerTransition(lock)
                .registerTransition(pushLocked)
                .registerTransition(unlock)
                .registerTransition(coinUnlocked)
                .activateJmxMonitoring()
                .build();

        /*
         * Fire some events and print FSM state
         */
        System.out.println("Turnstile initial state : " + finiteStateMachine.getCurrentState().getName());

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Which event do you want to fire?");
        System.out.println("1. Push [p]");
        System.out.println("2. Coin [c]");
        System.out.println("Press [q] to quit tutorial.");
        while (true) {
            String input = scanner.nextLine();
            if (input.trim().equalsIgnoreCase("p")) {
                System.out.println("input = " + input.trim());
                System.out.println("Firing push event..");
                finiteStateMachine.fire(new PushEvent());
                System.out.println("Turnstile state : " + finiteStateMachine.getCurrentState().getName());
            }
            if (input.trim().equalsIgnoreCase("c")) {
                System.out.println("input = " + input.trim());
                System.out.println("Firing coin event..");
                finiteStateMachine.fire(new CoinEvent());
                System.out.println("Turnstile state : " + finiteStateMachine.getCurrentState().getName());
            }
            if (input.trim().equalsIgnoreCase("q")) {
                System.out.println("input = " + input.trim());
                System.out.println("Bye!");
                System.exit(0);
            }

        }

    }
}
```
